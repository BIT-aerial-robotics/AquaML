Dear editor:

I'm not sure if it is the right time to contact you to inquire about the status of my submitted manuscript. My manuscript, "End-to-End Landing of UAVs via Deep Reinforcement Learning: Lightweight Simulator, Generalization Training, and Sim-to-Real Transfer" (ROB-23-0179), has been submitted to your journal on 27 April 2023. The status of " Under Review " for my manuscript has been lasting for approximately six monthes. I would be grateful if you could let me know any further information about my manuscript at your earliest convenience.

With best regards!

Yours sincerely

Tao Yang
